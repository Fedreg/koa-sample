# Koa starter.

### Koa is a GREAT micro server framework for Node.js.  

This is a starter for personal use on a few upcoming projects that need a basic server.  Documented in case this is helpful for anyone else.   Tested Express, Hapi, Sails, and Koa.  Koa won. YMMV.

This starter serves as an example demonstrating:
* Babel integration for use of ES6 async/await (no more callbacks! ...some promises still required)
* Routing
* Templating (uses Pug)
* Reading Files
* ORM -> (TODO)
* DB fetch and write data -> (currently in memory TODO)
* 404
